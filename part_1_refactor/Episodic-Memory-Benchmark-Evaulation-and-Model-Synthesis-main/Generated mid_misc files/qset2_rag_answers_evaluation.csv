qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,1,Repeat the list replacing every “banana” with “pear”.,"Answer:
NOT_IN_CONTEXT
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to repeat a list replacing every ""banana"" with ""pear"". But looking at the provided context, there's no mention of the word ""banana"" at all. The context talks about a parkour workshop, a fashion show, and some other events, but none of those texts include the word ""banana"". The user's instruction is to replace ""banana"" with ""pear"" in a list, but since the context doesn't have any ""banana"" words, the correct response would be NOT_IN_CONTEXT. I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden references. Let me check again. The first chapter mentions a meteor, dates like April 09, 2026, but no bananas. The second chapter talks about a fashion show with glittering butterflies and stardust. The third chapter mentions a photography exhibition. No ""banana"" words here. So the answer is definitely NOT_IN_CONTEXT.

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,4,Identify which group contains an inconsistent element.,"Answer:
The group that contains an inconsistent element is the one discussing data privacy on the Snug Harbor Cultural Center bridge. The context describes a scene where Julian is discussing data privacy with a group of young, bright-eyed developers, but the rest of the text focuses on a parkour workshop and a hackathon. The mention of data privacy on the bridge seems out of place and inconsistent with the other events described in the context.

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,6,Check if “Daniel” appears before “Olivia” in the list.,"Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if ""Daniel"" appears before ""Olivia"" in the list. But looking at the provided context, I need to check all the text to see if both names are mentioned and their order.

First, I'll scan through each chapter. In Chapter 1, the names mentioned are Ezra Edwards, Noa Middleton, Mara Ledbetter, and Samuel Parker. Then in Chapter 2, there's Sienna Hamrick and Chloe. In Chapter 38, Olivia Turner is mentioned. In Chapter 39, Samuel Parker is there again. 

Wait, the question is about Daniel and Olivia. The context doesn't mention Daniel at all. The names present are Olivia, Samuel, Sienna, Ezra, Noa, Mara, Alayah Montanez, Justin Valentine, Jace Waddell, Calvin Schaub. There's no Daniel in the text. So the answer is that Daniel isn't in the context. Therefore, the answer is NOT_IN_CONTEXT.

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,9,List last city mentioned for each day in a timeline.,"Answer:
Okay, let's see. The user is asking to list the last city mentioned for each day in a timeline based on the provided context. 

First, I need to parse through the given text to find instances where a city is mentioned along with a date. The context has several sections, each starting with ""Chapter X"" and some dates like February 27, 2026, May 11, 2026, September 22, 2026, March 23, 2024. 

Looking at each part:

1. The first part mentions ""February 27, 2026"" and the city is ""the city"" but not specified. However, later in the text, there's a mention of ""the High Line"" which is a park in New York City. Also, ""the city"" is mentioned in the context of the bridge and the park. But the exact city name might be New York City, but the text doesn't explicitly say that. Wait, the High Line is in New York, but the text doesn't state that. Hmm.

Wait, the first part mentions ""the bridge"" and ""the city lights"" but doesn't specify the city. Then in the second part, there's a mention of ""the High Line"" which is a park in New York City. Then in the third part, ""the park"" is mentioned, but not the city. Then in the fourth part, ""the city"" again, but not the name. 

Wait, looking again:

In the first chapter, the bridge is mentioned, but the city isn't named. Then in the second part, the High Line is mentioned, which is in New York City. Then in the third part, the High Line is again mentioned. Then in the fourth part, the date is March 23, 2024, and the location is ""Washington Square Park,"" which is in New York City. 

So, the dates and cities:

- February 27, 2026: The High Line is mentioned, which is in New York City. But the text doesn't explicitly say ""New York City,"" but since the High Line is a well-known park in NYC, maybe that's the city. However, the text might not state it. Wait, the first part mentions ""the city"" but not the name. The High Line is in New York, but the text doesn't say that",9,0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'raw': 'JUDGE_API_ERROR: HTTPSConnectionPool(host=\'api.openrouter.ai\', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /v1/completions (Caused by NameResolutionError(""<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7aeb9f362480>: Failed to resolve \'api.openrouter.ai\' ([Errno -2] Name or service not known)""))'}",NOT_IN_CONTEXT
qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,10,List final items each role holds after exchanges.,"Answer:
Okay, let's see. The user is asking to list the final items each role holds after exchanges. The context provided is from several chapters of a story, mainly focusing on characters like Samuel Parker, Daisy Whittington, Mabel Navarro, Mila, Julian Ross, Angelina Woodard, Mila, Koa Berlin, Emilia Hooks, Daphne Ivey, Ronnie Vest, Carter Stewart, Sasha Dickerson, and Blythe Novotny. 

Looking at the text, there are mentions of characters in different scenes: a theater performance, an astronomy night at a museum, and a murder mystery dinner. The question is about ""final items each role holds after exchanges."" The term ""exchanges"" here might refer to interactions or dialogues between characters.

However, the context doesn't explicitly mention any items that roles hold. The text describes the actions, emotions, and interactions of the characters, but there's no mention of specific items or objects that they hold. For example, in the theater scene, there's a mention of a stage, a spotlight, but not items. In the museum scene, there are mentions of exhibits, displays, but again, no specific items. The murder mystery dinner scene has a murder mystery, but again, no items are listed.

The user might be referring to something like roles in a game or a system where each role has an item, but the context doesn't provide such information. The answer is likely that there's no information about items held by roles in the given context. Therefore, the answer should be NOT_IN_CONTEXT.
Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT
The provided context does not mention any specific items that each role holds after exchanges. The text focuses on character interactions, settings, and emotions, but there is no explicit information about items associated with each role. Therefore, the answer is NOT_IN_CONTEXT. 
Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT
The context provided does not contain information about items held by each role after exchanges. The text describes characters, their actions, and the settings, but there is no mention of specific items associated with their roles. Therefore, the answer is NOT_IN_CONTEXT. 
Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT
The context does not provide information about the final items each role holds after exchanges. The text focuses on character interactions, settings, and emotions, but there is no mention of specific items associated with the roles. Therefore, the answer is NOT_IN_CONTEXT.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking to update Ava Gray’s event list after replacements or removals. I need to check the provided context to see if there's any information about Ava Gray's events.

Looking through the context, there are mentions of several events: a networking event at High Line on March 23, 2024, a debate on May 28, 2025, a celestial navigation workshop in Washington Square Park, a craft beer festival on October 13, 2024, and a parkour workshop. However, the name ""Ava Gray"" isn't mentioned anywhere in the provided text. The events mentioned are associated with different people like Henry Reed, Chloe, Zoe Brown, and others, but not Ava Gray. 

The user is asking about updating an event list for Ava Gray, but the context doesn't contain any information about Ava Gray's events. The answer should be NOT_IN_CONTEXT because there's no mention of Ava Gray in the given text. The events listed are for other people, and there's no indication of replacements or removals related to Ava Gray. Therefore, the correct response is NOT_IN_CONTEXT.

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,14,List final items of each Knitting Circle role.,"Answer:
NOT_IN_CONTEXT
Okay, let's see. The user is asking to list the final items of each Knitting Circle role. I need to check the provided context to see if there's any information about knitting circles or roles related to that.

Looking through the context, there's a part about a parkour scene where Owen is trying to do parkour, but that's not related. Then there's a mention of a murder mystery dinner, and some characters like Mila, Koa Berlin, Emilia Hooks. Then there's a part about Noah Williams at the Williamsburg Bridge, and some other characters like Daphne Ivey, Carter Stewart, Sasha Dickerson, Blythe Novotny. 

Wait, the user mentioned ""Knitting Circle role."" But in the context, the only mention of knitting is in the part where Owen is talking about taking up knitting instead of parkour. The text says: ""Owen groaned, wondering if it was too late to take up knitting instead."" But there's no mention of a Knitting Circle role or any specific items related to it. 

The context doesn't provide any information about the roles in a Knitting Circle or their final items. The answer should be NOT_IN_CONTEXT because the required information isn't present in the given text.
Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT
The context provided does not mention any ""Knitting Circle roles"" or their final items.

Since June 14, 2025 is after October 13, 2024, Ava’s book signing (Scarlett Thomas's event) occurred after the Film Festival.
No, Ava’s Book Signing did not occur before the Film Festival. The text indicates that the Film Festival took place on October 13, 2024, while Scarlett Thomas's book signing was on June 14, 2025, which is later. Therefore, Ava’s book signing occurred after the Film Festival.

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,18,List final attendees after daily updates to event.,"Answer:
NOT_IN_CONTEXT
Okay, let's see. The user is asking to list the final attendees after daily updates to the event. I need to check the provided context to see if there's any information about attendees.

Looking through the chapters, in Chapter 5, there's mention of Meredith Gardner, Uri Wemple, Ryleigh Russell, Noah Williams, and others like Carter Stewart, Sasha Dickerson, Anika Fox, Zoe, Frey Matson, Ari Cartwright. Also in Chapter 36, Henry Reed, Pax Langston, and in Chapter 41, Brooklyn Ross. 

But the question is about ""final attendees after daily updates to event."" The context mentions specific people in different chapters, but does it list them as attendees of an event? For example, in Chapter 5, the event is the networking event at High Line. The attendees mentioned are Meredith, Uri, Ryleigh, Noah, Carter, Sasha, Blythe, Anika, Zoe, Frey, Ari. 

In Chapter 36, the event is a fashion show, with Henry Reed, Anika Fox, and others. In Chapter 41, the film festival's grand finale with Brooklyn Ross. 

But the user is asking for the final attendees after daily updates. The context does mention specific people in different events, but does it list them as attendees? The answer would be the people mentioned in each chapter's event. However, the user might be referring to the hackathon in Chapter 36, where Zoe, Frey, Ari, and others are mentioned. 

Wait, the question is about ""final attendees after daily updates to event."" The context has multiple events: the networking event (Chapter 5), the hackathon (Chapter 36), and the film festival (Chapter 41). The answer would be the people mentioned in each event. However, the user might be referring to the hackathon in Chapter 36, where Zoe, Frey, Ari, and others are present. 

But the answer needs to be based on the context. The context lists attendees in different events, but the question is about ""final attendees after daily updates to event."" The answer would be the people mentioned in each event's context. However, the answer is supposed to be a list. But the context doesn't explicitly list all attendees; it's more about specific individuals in different scenes.

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,20,Order Ava Gray’s city visits and identify second stop.,"Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT
Okay, let's see. The user is asking to order Ava Gray’s city visits and identify the second stop. I need to check the provided context to see if there's any information about Ava Gray's city visits.

Looking through the context given, there are several chapters mentioned, like Chapter 21, 27, and parts of the story involving Mila Gonzalez, Noah, Nylah Zavala, and others. However, the name ""Ava Gray"" isn't mentioned anywhere in the text. The characters mentioned are Mila Gonzalez, Noah, Nylah Zavala, Samuel Parker, etc., but no Ava Gray. 

The user is asking about Ava Gray's city visits, but the context provided doesn't contain any information about her. The chapters talk about events in New York City, like the park competition, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and other locations like Fire Island, but those are part of the story's setting, not related to Ava Gray's visits.

Since there's no mention of Ava Gray's visits or any cities she visited, the answer must be that it's not in the context. The user's question is about ordering her city visits and identifying the second stop, but without any info on Ava Gray in the provided text, the answer is NOT_IN_CONTEXT.
Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT
The context provided does not mention Ava Gray or any of her city visits. Therefore, the answer is NOT_IN_CONTEXT.

There's a mention of events like the beer festival, a fashion show, a book signing, and a debate. However, the question is about Thomas Nelson, but the context doesn't mention Thomas Nelson at all. The character named Scarlett Thomas is involved in events, but Thomas Nelson isn't referenced. The user might have confused the name. The context doesn't provide any information about Thomas Nelson's events. So the answer should be NOT_IN_CONTEXT.

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,22,List final Improv Comedy Show participants after updates.,"Answer:
NOT_IN_CONTEXT
Okay, let's see. The user is asking to list the final Improv Comedy Show participants after updates. I need to check the provided context to see if there's any information about participants of an improv comedy show.

Looking through the context, there's a mention of a debate tournament and a hackathon, but the user is asking about an improv comedy show. The text mentions a debate tournament with elements of comedy, like the final round where participants did absurd gestures, but that's a debate, not an improv comedy show. 

Then there's a part about a parkour workshop, but again, not related. The context also includes a section about a code review and a hackathon. None of these mention an improv comedy show or its participants. The only mention of a show is the debate tournament, which is a different event. 

The user might be confusing the debate tournament with an improv comedy show. However, the context doesn't provide any information about participants of an improv comedy show. The answer should be NOT_IN_CONTEXT because there's no mention of such a show or its participants in the given text.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking to identify who was newly added in List 2 vs List 1. But looking at the provided context, there's no mention of any lists or comparisons between List 1 and List 2. The context consists of several chapters from a story, each describing different scenes and events. There's a mention of characters like Henry Reed, Zander Davenport, Oakley Goetz, Chloe Castillo, Reid Blunt, Noa Middleton, Mara Ledbetter, Ezra Edwards, Sienna Hamrick, and others. However, there's no indication of two lists being compared here. The user might have intended to refer to some lists mentioned in the original question, but based on the given context, there's no information about List 1 and List 2. Therefore, the answer should be NOT_IN_CONTEXT.

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,28,Chronologically order events and find same-city attendees.,"Answer:
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants me to chronologically order the events and find the same-city attendees based on the provided context.

First, I need to parse through the given text to identify the events in order and determine who is in the same city. The context has several chapters, each describing different scenes and events.

Looking at the first part, Chapter 21 talks about Mila hosting a compound bow competition in a park. Then, in Chapter 27, there's a mention of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Then, Chapter 5 describes a networking event at the High Line. Also, there's a mention of a hackathon in Chapter 5, where Zoe is involved. 

The dates mentioned in the text are March 23, 2024, and September 22, 2026. The High Line event is on March 23, 2024, while the Met Museum event is in the same context but not specified with a date. However, the Met Museum is in New York City, as is the High Line and the Hackathon. The other events, like the bow competition, are also in New York, given the references to Washington Square Park and the East River.

So, the events in order would be:

1. The compound bow competition on March 23, 2024, at Washington Square Park.
2. The networking event at the High Line on the same date, March 23, 2024.
3. The hackathon, which is mentioned in the context of the Met Museum, but the exact date isn't given. However, the Met Museum is in New York, so the attendees are in the same city.

The same-city attendees would be those at the High Line event and the Met Museum event, both in New York. The bow competition is also in New York. However, the question is about same-city attendees. The answer should list the events in order and the attendees in the same city.

Wait, the user is asking to chronologically order the events and find the same-city attendees. So, the events in order are:

- The compound bow competition on March 23, 2024, at Washington Square Park.
- The High Line networking event on the same day, March 23, 2024.
- The Met Museum event, which is in the same city (New York), but the date isn't specified.",28,0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'raw': 'JUDGE_API_ERROR: HTTPSConnectionPool(host=\'api.openrouter.ai\', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /v1/completions (Caused by NameResolutionError(""<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7aeb9f3624e0>: Failed to resolve \'api.openrouter.ai\' ([Errno -2] Name or service not known)""))'}",NOT_IN_CONTEXT

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,30,Identify which brief layover location was removed during itinerary revisions.,"Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT
Okay, let's see. The user is asking to identify which brief layover location was removed during itinerary revisions. I need to check the provided context to see if there's any mention of itinerary revisions or layover locations being removed.

Looking through the context, there are several chapters mentioned, like Chapter 49, 19, 1, and some scenes involving astronomy, a theater performance, a debate, and a parkour workshop. The text seems to be a mix of different stories or scenes, but none of them mention anything about itineraries, layovers, or revisions. The terms like ""itinerary revisions"" or ""layover location"" aren't present in the provided text. 

The first part talks about a celestial map, a telescope, and a group aiming at a star. Then there's a part about a Metropolitan Museum, a performance, a debate, and a parkour workshop. None of these scenes mention any travel itineraries, layovers, or changes to them. The answer is definitely not in the context because there's no mention of such things. So the correct response is NOT_IN_CONTEXT.

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,31,List all compact items referenced during the portable-gear check at the rest stop.,"Answer:
NOT_IN_CONTEXT
Okay, let's see. The user is asking to list all compact items referenced during the portable-gear check at the rest stop. I need to check the provided context to find any mentions of portable gear or items checked at a rest stop.

Looking through the chapters, the first part talks about an ice exhibition, Henry Reed's thoughts on art, and the end of the exhibition. Then there's a section about a parkour workshop, Chloe Castillo's experience, and a description of a fashion show. The third chapter mentions a photography exhibition. 

Wait, the user mentioned a ""rest stop"" and ""portable-gear check."" I need to check if any of these chapters talk about a rest stop or checking gear. Let me scan again.

Looking at the text, there's a mention of a parkour workshop on May 11, 2026, but that's the exhibition date. Then in Chapter 12, there's a description of the High Line and Chloe Castillo's feelings. The other chapters talk about a parkour workshop, a fashion show, and a photography exhibition. 

Wait, the term ""rest stop"" isn't mentioned anywhere. The context doesn't talk about a rest stop or checking portable gear. The answer is that there's no information about a portable-gear check at a rest stop. So the answer should be NOT_IN_CONTEXT.
Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,33,Track the total number of travel tokens collected by attendees during the early journey.,"Answer:
NOT_IN_CONTEXT
Okay, let's see. The user is asking to track the total number of travel tokens collected by attendees during the early journey.

First, I need to check the provided context to see if there's any mention of travel tokens or attendees collecting them. 

Looking through the text, there are several chapters mentioned, like Chapter 40, 10, 12, etc. Each chapter seems to be a different scene or story. The first part talks about a hackathon with Julian, Hezekiah Bean, Sienna Lyles, and others. Then there's a part about Zoe Brown, a hackathon on February 27, 2026. Then there's a part about Mila Gonzalez and the Statue of Liberty. Then there's a part about Henry Reed and an ice-themed exhibition. Then Chloe Castillo at the High Line.

Now, the question is about ""travel tokens collected by attendees during the early journey."" The context doesn't mention anything about travel tokens. The terms ""travel tokens"" aren't used anywhere in the provided text. The chapters talk about hackathons, performances, exhibitions, parkour workshops, but nothing about tokens, especially travel tokens. 

The answer is definitely NOT_IN_CONTEXT because there's no information provided about travel tokens being collected by attendees. The user is asking for a count, but the context doesn't have any data on that. So, the correct response is to say it's not in the context.
Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT
The context provided does not mention anything about ""travel tokens"" or their collection by attendees. Therefore, the total number cannot be determined from the given information. Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,34,Which small detail from the travel diary contradicts the later summarized route?,"Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT
The provided text does not contain a travel diary or any information that would allow us to determine which small detail contradicts the later summarized route. The text is a series of narrative passages from different chapters of a story, not a travel diary. Therefore, the answer is NOT_IN_CONTEXT.
The answer is NOT_IN_CONTEXT.
Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT
Okay, let's see. The user is asking which small detail from the travel diary contradicts the later summarized route. But looking at the provided context, there's no mention of a travel diary. The text consists of several chapters from a story, like a hackathon, a parkour workshop, and some other events. There's a mention of a telescope, a festival, a sculpture park, but nothing about a travel diary or a summarized route that contradicts a detail from it. The answer is definitely NOT_IN_CONTEXT because the necessary elements (a travel diary and a summarized route) aren't present in the given text. So, the correct response is NOT_IN_CONTEXT.

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,36,List all minor descriptive elements visible around the resting checkpoint and categorize them.,"Answer:
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants me to list all minor descriptive elements visible around the resting checkpoint and categorize them. But first, I need to understand what a ""resting checkpoint"" refers to. The provided context has several chapters, but none mention a ""resting checkpoint."" 

Looking through the text, there are mentions of places like the New York Botanical Garden, the American Museum of Natural History, and a photography exhibition. However, the term ""resting checkpoint"" isn't used anywhere. The closest thing might be the ""checkpoint"" in the context of the photography exhibition, but that's not a standard term.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a specific location mentioned in the text. Let me check again. The chapters talk about events at the American Museum of Natural History, a photography exhibition, and other settings like the New York Botanical Garden. However, there's no mention of a ""resting checkpoint"" in any of these locations. 

The context does have descriptions of environments like the night sky, the telescope, the workshop, the museum, the photography exhibition, and other scenes. But the term ""resting checkpoint"" isn't present. The user might be using a term that's not in the text. 

Since the question is about elements around a ""resting checkpoint"" and the context doesn't mention such a term, the answer would be that it's not in the context. The user might have a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe ""checkpoint"" refers to a specific location in the text, but I don't see that. 

Looking again, in Chapter 9, there's a mention of a ""resting checkpoint"" in the context of a performance, but the text doesn't specify. The answer is that there's no information about a ""resting checkpoint"" in the provided context. Therefore, the correct response is NOT_IN_CONTEXT.

qset2_rag_answers.csv,rag,38,Identify which short personal break taken by Ava does not reappear later in the travel log.,"Answer: NOT_IN_CONTEXT
Okay, let's see. The user is asking to identify which short personal break taken by Ava does not reappear later in the travel log. 

First, I need to check the provided context to see if there's any mention of Ava's personal breaks. Let me go through the text again.

Looking at the chapters provided, there's a mention of ""Ava"" in Chapter 17, where Zoe Brown is interacting with Remy Waterman. Wait, no, the user mentioned ""Ava"" but in the context, the names mentioned are Zoe Brown, Remy Waterman, Nylah Zavala, Mila Gonzalez, Nash Ensign, Julian, Angelina Woodard, Carter Stewart, Meredith Strand. Wait, the user is talking about ""Ava"" but the context doesn't mention a character named Ava. The chapters are about different people: the first part is about a tech hackathon with Henry, Jace Waddell, and others. Then there's a play in a cathedral with Nylah Zavala, Mila Gonzalez, Nash Ensign. Then a tech hackathon at Port Jefferson with Zoe Brown and Remy Waterman. Then a museum event with Julian and Angelina. Then a play in a cathedral again with Carter Stewart and Meredith Strand.

Wait, the user is asking about a ""short personal break taken by Ava"" that doesn't reappear in the travel log. But looking at the context, there's no mention of a character named Ava. The names in the text are Zoe Brown, Remy Waterman, Nylah Zavala, Mila Gonzalez, Nash Ensign, Julian, Angelina Woodard, Carter Stewart, Meredith Strand. There's no Ava mentioned. So the answer would be that the context doesn't contain any information about Ava's personal breaks. Therefore, the answer is NOT_IN_CONTEXT.
