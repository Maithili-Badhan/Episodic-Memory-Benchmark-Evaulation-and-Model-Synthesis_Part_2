{"answers_file":"qset2_rag_answers.csv","method":"rag","qid":1,"question":"Repeat the list replacing every \u201cbanana\u201d with \u201cpear\u201d.","model_answer":"Answer:\nNOT_IN_CONTEXT\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to repeat a list replacing every \"banana\" with \"pear\". But looking at the provided context, there's no mention of the word \"banana\" at all. The context talks about a parkour workshop, a fashion show, and some other events, but none of those texts include the word \"banana\". The user's instruction is to replace \"banana\" with \"pear\" in a list, but since the context doesn't have any \"banana\" words, the correct response would be NOT_IN_CONTEXT. I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden references. Let me check again. The first chapter mentions a meteor, dates like April 09, 2026, but no bananas. The second chapter talks about a fashion show with glittering butterflies and stardust. The third chapter mentions a photography exhibition. No \"banana\" words here.
