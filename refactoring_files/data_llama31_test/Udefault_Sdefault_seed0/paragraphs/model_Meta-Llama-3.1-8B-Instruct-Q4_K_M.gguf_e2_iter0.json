"(1) The dimly lit gallery, a converted warehouse on the outskirts of , hummed with the soft chatter of photographers and art enthusiasts on this crisp September evening in 2026. I stood amidst the crowd, my eyes scanning the room as I sipped a lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste a stark contrast to the sweet aroma of the freshly brewed coffee wafting from the café next door. A faint scent of old books and dust lingered in the air, transporting me to a bygone era. I had been looking forward to this exhibition all week, and now that I was finally here, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It wasn't just the crowd that made me feel this way; it was the fact that I had been asked to speak about post-processing techniques, a topic I was passionate about, but also one that made me feel vulnerable. As I made my way through the throng of people, I caught glimpses of $entity_1's photographs, their vibrant colors and textures a testament to her skill and artistry. I spotted $entity_2 lingering by the refreshments, a look of quiet contemplation on her face as she sipped a glass of wine. My eyes wandered back to the photographs, and I felt a pang of recognition – I had seen some of these images before, but in a different context. A nagging sense of familiarity began to creep in, and I knew I had to investigate further. The soft glow of the gallery's lighting cast an otherworldly ambiance, as if the very walls were alive and watching me. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I continued to scan the room, my mind racing with possibilities. The air was thick with anticipation, the crowd's collective energy building towards a crescendo. I spotted $entity_3, her eyes locked onto mine, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. I felt a jolt of recognition, but it was quickly replaced by a sense of unease – I couldn't quite place her. The sound of my own voice echoed in my mind, a reminder of the speech I had given earlier,. Port Jefferson. September 22, 2026. Henry Reed. Explained post-processing techniques."
