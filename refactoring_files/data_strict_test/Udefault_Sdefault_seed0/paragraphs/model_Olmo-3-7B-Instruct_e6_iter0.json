"(i) The marble-white sculptures shimmered under the pale February light, their edges blurred by the faint mist rising from the frozen pond at the heart of the gathering. Laughter and the soft click of heels echoed through the throng of visitors, but Benjamin noticed the hush that settled whenever a particularly intricate form caught the sun’s reflection—a fleeting, crystalline ghost among the living.\n\n(ii) He moved between tables, his breath visible in the cold air, hands wrapped tight around the lecture notes he had prepared.

The scent of chilled air and the faint tang of melting ice mingled, a reminder of the impermanence that haunted every display.\n\n(iii) Near the center of the square, a young sculptor knelt, chiseling new patterns into a block of translucent blue ice.
