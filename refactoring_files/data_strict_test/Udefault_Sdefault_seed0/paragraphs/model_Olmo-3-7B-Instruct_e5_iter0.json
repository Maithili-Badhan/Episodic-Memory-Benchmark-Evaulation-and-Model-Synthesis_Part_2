"(i) The hum of encrypted chatter and the sharp click of keyboards filled the marble-clad corridors of the Woolworth Building as Julian Ross slipped through the entrance, his tailored jacket brushing against the cool steel railings. Above, the glass façade caught the late afternoon light, casting fractured rainbows across the crowd of inventors and dreamers gathered for the annual Urban Tech Hackathon. \n\n(ii) He moved with the quiet purpose of someone who knew exactly where they belonged, though the sea of faces blurred around him—startups in neon T-shirts, hackers with laptops glowing like neon beacons, and a few nervous first-timers clutching half-finished prototypes. Julian’s gaze swept the room, cataloguing the energy: anticipation, frustration, and the faint scent of burnt coffee wafting from the open kitchen area.\n\n(iii) During the afternoon mentoring sessions, Julian guided a team of wide-eyed undergraduates through the nitty-gritty of integrating AI vision into their smart waste-sorting device. His voice was calm, a steady anchor in the storm of ideas and deadlines, as he helped them debug a stubborn API call that had left their prototype stymied. \n\n(iv) Now, as the event swelled toward its climax, Julian found himself drawn toward a corner table where a group was huddled over a holographic display, their code scrolling in real-time. The leader, a sharp-eyed woman with a streak of silver in her dark hair, turned as Julian approached. “We’re stuck on the authentication—can you take a look?” she asked, her tone hopeful but edged with fatigue.\n\n(v) He nodded, sliding into the seat across from her.
