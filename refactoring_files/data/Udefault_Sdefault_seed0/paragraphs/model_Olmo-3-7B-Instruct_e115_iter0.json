"(1) The low, echoing hum of twin propellers reverberated across the marble and glass, a counterpoint to the clapping crowd that pulsed in rhythmic anticipation. Brooklyn Ross’s boots pressed silently against the polished floor as she navigated the labyrinth of exhibits that lined the museum’s vast gallery. Above, the spiral ramp of the main atrium unfurled in a silver arc, glinting under the overhead LEDs that cast the visitors’ faces in cool violet. She moved like a shadow between display panels—careful, deliberate—her presence as unassuming as the sleek black drones hovering near the ceiling.\n\n(2) The air was thick with the burnt-ozone smell of rapidly whirring motors and the sharp tang of electronic adhesives. Spectators pressed close to reinforced viewing glass, their eyes wide, tracking the aerial ballet of racing drones weaving between obstacles that spun on hydraulic arms overhead. The announcer’s voice crackled through hidden speakers, narrating the competitors’ names and scores, but Brooklyn’s focus stayed fixed upward, eyes tracking the shifting trails of light cast by the whirring machines.\n\n(3) She noticed a small group gathered behind a velvet curtain, murmuring over holographic displays. The group’s leader—a wiry man in a faded racing jacket—glanced at Brooklyn with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism. $entity_1 leaned in, whispering something about ‘cheating,’ and Brooklyn pressed her lips together in a silent rebuke. She couldn’t let a simple rumor disrupt the demonstration she’d carefully rigged for this morning.\n\n(4) The tension in the room shifted when a loud crack—a metallic snap—echoed from the adjacent gallery. Everyone stiffened. Brooklyn’s trained hand flicked toward her belt, where a compact scanner and a few countermeasure devices rested. Instinct took over; she counted two quick footfalls, a shadow slipping past the security desk. $entity_2, a woman with sharp features and nervous hands, darted into view and froze when Brooklyn’s gaze met hers. Suspicion sharpened her eyes.\n\n(5) Unbothered by the commotion, Brooklyn guided a demonstration drone along a controlled path, its propellers shimmering blue. Her voice, low and steady, explained the purpose behind the show. “Observe,” she said, not looking at the audience directly but at the drone as it dodged an automated obstacle. The crowd leaned in, but a few faces betrayed doubt. Brooklyn noticed the flicker in the man from earlier, now whispering furiously to another attendee, $entity_3.\n\n(6) On"
