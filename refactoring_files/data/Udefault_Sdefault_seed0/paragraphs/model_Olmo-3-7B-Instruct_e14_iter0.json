"(1) The hush of chilled New York air pressed through the steel and glass expanse of the American Museum of Natural History, mingling with the distant murmur of excited voices echoing from the Grand Hall. Focused floodlights painted constellations across the ceiling of the dome, their swirling blues and golds making the room feel both immense and cocooned. Overhead, the familiar silhouette of the pterodactyl bone arch loomed, but tonight its shadow was overshadowed by a thousand lights focused on star charts and telescopes set up like sentries across the marble floors. \n\n(2) On December 26, 2026, the calendar’s late-winter date lent a peculiar clarity to the night: the city’s frost lay undisturbed, yet the museum felt charged with anticipation, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath for the evening’s unraveling.

Unaware of the game at hand, $entity_1 leaned in, eyes alight with urgency. Levi noted the way they all glanced back at the clock, each waiting for his signal, as if deciphering a message only he knew was being broadcast. \n\n(5) Finally, Levi Rodriguez, host of the evening’s astronomy trivia contests, raised a gloved hand. “All right—round two! Who can tell me the constellation best associated with winter solstice celebrations?” The room erupted into sudden motion—names called, phones out, minds racing. Levi smiled faintly, watching $entity_3 answer confidently, the"
