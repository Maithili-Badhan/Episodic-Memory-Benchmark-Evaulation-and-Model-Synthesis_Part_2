"(1) Neon strips flickered behind glass walls as the Snug Harbor Cultural Center hummed with the low murmur of inventors. Inside the glass-walled convention hall, the scent of solder and old paper mingled, sharp and electric. Rows of folding chairs and crowded workstations lined the room, every surface cluttered with tools, half-built gadgets, and sticky notes with frantic ideas scribbled across them. \n\n(2) Levi kept a tight grip on his backpack, heart thumping faster with each passing minute. The registration desk was swamped; he’d barely gotten through security when a voice shouted, “Team 23, move your soldering irons! We need space for the demo stage!” He caught glimpses of laptops, drones, and a tangle of wires everywhere, the air crackling with possibility and the undercurrent of competition.\n\n(3) Across the aisle, a woman in a black hoodie flicked through a schematic on her tablet, her fingers moving with practiced speed. Two boys hunched over a breadboard, their faces illuminated by the harsh LED glow, arguing in rapid, overlapping sentences. The sense of urgency was contagious—a day where sleepers could become the next big disruptor.\n\n(4) A speaker crackled to life above the rising energy. “Welcome, everyone, to Snug Harbor’s annual Tech Hackathon!” The announcement echoed, making the crowd shift in place, anticipation rippling through the room like a live wire. Levi’s throat tightened, wondering if he was one of the last to sign in, or just lucky to be here at all.\n\n(5) He moved toward the entrance of a side wing labeled “Workshops,” drawn by the promise of deeper access to tools. In the main hall, teams hustled, passing prototypes, some gleaming with possibility, others barely more than concepts scribbled on index cards. Every footstep felt amplified, as if the walls themselves were listening for a breakthrough.\n\n(6) The hardware hacking workshop took place in a converted art gallery: exposed beams, white walls splattered with spray paint, and a central table brimming with components—microcontrollers, sensors, microchips, and copper wire coiled like snake shadows. Here, the air was heavier, the hum of machinery more pronounced, and the silence between teams more intense, pregnant with the weight of unsolved problems.\n\n(7) That morning—on July 25, 2024—Levi Rodriguez slipped into the hardware hacking workshop just as the clock hit"
