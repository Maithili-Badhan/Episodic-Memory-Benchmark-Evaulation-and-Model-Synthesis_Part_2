Distant echoes of a distant drumbeat rippled through the labyrinthine passageways, the fog swallowing the arching iron railings and the uneven ground beneath tired sneakers. People milled restlessly, their faces half-lit by the soft glow of phone screens and the flicker of a dozen portable LED lanterns arranged in a loose circle.
