"(1)  \nThe lobby of what *used* to be just a regular, straightforward office tower was now painted entirely in ghostly blue, thanks to Maya’s personal touch for the celebrity event. Instead of glass that reflected sky or steel that whispered the winds of progress, the new walls shimmered, as if painted with the faint outlines of fog. Tour groups were squeezing through the metal doors, tripping over each other and laughing at the self-consciously dramatic tour guide who kept insisting, “The spirits don’t appreciate cheap cologne!”\n\n(2)  \nMaya’s heels clicked a nervous rhythm along the concourse as she trailed behind her entourage and an absolutely overwrought ghost story narrator.
