"(1)  \nThe flickering amber of the lanterns painted long shadows across the weather-beaten shingles of the old lighthouse keepers’ cottage perched above the dour sea. Smoke curled lazily from the crackling hearth, blending with the distant scent of salt and cold stone. Below, on the pebbled shore of Port Jefferson, a circle of flickering orange light gathered, pulses of heat and color rising in time with the pulse of a crowd hushed by ancient fear and rapt anticipation. Within this ring, Ezra Edwards moved with the sharp, controlled grace of a storm about to break—a dancer clad in leathers and embers, his chain whip slung loosely at his side.
