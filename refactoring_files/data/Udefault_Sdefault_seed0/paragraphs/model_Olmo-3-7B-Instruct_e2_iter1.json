"1. On September 22, 2026, beneath the arched ceiling of the little gallery at Port Jefferson, Henry Reed stood at the front among a murmuring crowd of art lovers, his hands lightly resting atop a sleek tablet where images from dozens of cameras shimmered in various stages of digital transformation. The coastal air carried the faint, briny scent of the nearby Sound, mingled with the sharp tang of fresh coffee and the hush of turning pages, as the flickering lights cast long shadows over black-and-white prints and vibrant digital canvases; in that space, he took his place at a makeshift podium, ready to unravel, for the curious onlookers and the skeptical critics alike, the secrets hidden in the layers of post-processing techniques that could reshape reality almost as easily as light shaped shadow on the film—his voice calm but deliberate, every word calculated to reveal how truth and illusion intertwined beneath the surface of each frame."
