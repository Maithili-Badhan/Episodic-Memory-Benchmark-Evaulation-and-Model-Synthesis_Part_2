"(1)  \nThe air bit with the sharp, briny tang of the sea, but tonight it was cut through with something sharper still—an ozone smell and the metallic underglow of colored lights reflecting off the rippling statue’s rusted skin. Zoe stood in the throng, her coat tight against the evening chill, but her mind drifted elsewhere. She’d been invited here by anonymous means—no name, just a cryptic note tucked into an old passport copy, the kind of invitation that felt more like a warning. As the performers’ rhythmic stomping echoed across the grounds, she caught flashes of movement: flames licking the edges of hula skirts, shadows twisting into living shapes. Her eyes lingered on the stage’s center where a dancer in obsidian leathers spun, a sphere of fire cradled in her hands. The heat shimmered, painting patterns across the sandstone, and Zoe’s pulse quickened. She felt a familiar tug—like anticipation before a crime scene is entered, when the ordinary edges of reality begin to blur.\n\n(2)  \nBy the third act, with the night air thick and the crowds hushed under a sky bruised by artificial stars, Zoe was drawn forward. She knew immediately why she was here: when the lead performer, $entity_1, flicked her arm, a crystal ball of fire arced through the air. Zoe $entity_2—though she only realized the label afterward, the name just another face in the crowd—had been watching closely. The sphere caught the moonlight above the statue’s crown, casting fractured gold across the ferry boats and the harbor’s darkness, then scattered, leaving only a smolder and the scent of burnt resin. In that instant, Zoe recognized the signature pattern: the telltale afterglow of controlled combustion, not random sparks but precise, almost calculated manipulation. Someone was demonstrating the very technique she’d mastered, or perhaps testing it—her instincts, honed through years of studying dangerous phenomena, prickled. The performance ended, applause rising, but Zoe could not turn away, the memory of fire and control burning in her mind, as if she’d just witnessed a clue in a case that might change everything."
