"(1)  \nThe marble floor of the church echoed faintly with the hush of anticipation as Mila approached the ornate doors, their gilded leaf motifs catching the early afternoon light slanting through leaded panes. She adjusted the silk scarf around her neck, noting the way the candles in the nave cast warm halos onto the ancient stone. Her seat had been assigned in the second tier, just behind the vestry where the ushers moved like silent ghosts between rows.\n\n(2)  \nInside, the air was thick with the scent of incense and old paper from the programs clutched tightly by those around her.
