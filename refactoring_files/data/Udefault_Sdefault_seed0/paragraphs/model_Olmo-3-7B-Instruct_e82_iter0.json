"(1)  \nIt was a Tuesday of late summer, and the kind of overcast New York day that makes the city smell like damp pavement and distant pretzels—perfect weather, Levi thought, for an exhibition that was almost certainly going to go horribly wrong. Wearing his signature bowtie askew, Levi Rodriguez shuffled through the crowd gathering at an otherwise ordinary patch of lawn in the middle of Washington... wait, no, he hadn’t figured it out yet. There were posters everywhere, and a flotilla of filmmakers in neon jackets, but Levi’s own booth—a fold-out table covered in blinking LEDs and a projector that looked like it had been stolen from a Star Trek prop room—was still waiting for guests.

Levi, in his infinite patience (and slightly too many espresso shots), obligingly rigged up a dance routine with the AR filter “Dancing Cinephile,” which made his left foot twitch uncontrollably with every beat.
