"(1)  \nThe metallic chill of the pier bit at Lucy’s ankles as she clambered up a steel stairway, past clusters of neon banners and the faint aroma of pretzels mingling with ozone from a drone fleet testing above. Atop the granite monolith, under strings of flickering LED lights strung between support beams, a sea of techwearers huddled haphazardly among folding tables, laptops buzzing like angry hornets. Some had 3D-printed earpieces, others sported holographic projectors, but none, Lucy supposed, had the nerve to set up shop right at the base of the Statue of Liberty itself. \n\n(2)  \nThe clock on the digital kiosk read “08:17 AM,” though Lucy wasn’t sure she could trust it given the nearby WiFi kept dropping in and out with the rhythm of someone’s heavy metal death-core playlist. $entity_1—lanky, with a hoodie emblazoned “I ❤️ AI” in garish pink—was frantically untangling a Bluetooth cable as $entity_2 tried to charge their phone via a solar charger, only for it to sizzle and emit a plume of burnt toast aroma.

Suddenly, the grumpy $entity_3 in the adjacent booth burst out laughing, tripping over a drone charging cable as they clapped her on the back. “You just turned our demo into a pizza ordering app for storm chasers!” \n\n(4)  \n$entity_4 rolled their eyes but couldn’t help snorting as Lucy grinned, her cheeks pink from cold and victory alike. Lucy Carter, only now noticing she was the only one still dry-eyed, had just done what she set out to do: mashed together three strangers’ APIs like a madwoman at an all-you-can-eat code buffet. The tech crowd erupted in applause, and for the first time that morning, Lucy let herself breathe, savoring"
