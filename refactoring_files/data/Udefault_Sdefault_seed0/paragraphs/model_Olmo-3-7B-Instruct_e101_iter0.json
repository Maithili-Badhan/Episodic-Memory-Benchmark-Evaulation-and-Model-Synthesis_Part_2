"(1) Rain taps a steady rhythm on the iron railings above Julian as he lingers at the entrance of the temporary pavilion set among the ancient stones of Washington Square. The air bites at his cheeks, sharp with the ozone tang of recent rain and the faint scent of fallen leaves. Distant laughter from a nearby café blends with the metallic echo of footsteps on pavement.
