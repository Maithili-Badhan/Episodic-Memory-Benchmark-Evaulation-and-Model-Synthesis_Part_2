"(1)  \nThe lobby air hung heavy with the scent of old stone and fresh chalk, a paradox woven into the ornate granite arches of the Woolworth Building. Carter Stewart paused near the bronze entrance, his breath fogging in the cool morning current that trickled from the atrium’s open grill. Across from him, rows of folding chairs faced a polished concrete stage, where a whiteboard hummed with faint blue light. His attention flickered to the rows of name tags—unfilled, for now—each slot waiting for a new presence.\n\n(2)  \nHe was here, as instructed, though the role he played today felt alien in his own skin. Carter Stewart observed the shuffle of feet, the hush that fell like a curtain when the facilitator, a woman with silver in her cropped bob, raised her hand. He felt the press of unfamiliar faces around him, their intent glinting under the fluorescent lights.

Their eyes darted to the door more than to the speaker, as if expecting an intrusion rather than a learning experience. The architecture pressed in, stone and glass both old and new, all that stood between him and the unknown.\n\n(5)  \nA man in a charcoal blazer glanced at his phone, then back to the stage, shoulders stiff. Carter watched a woman scribble furiously in a notebook, her pen moving like the needle of a detective’s mind. The facilitator cleared her throat, her voice echoing with crisp authority. “"
