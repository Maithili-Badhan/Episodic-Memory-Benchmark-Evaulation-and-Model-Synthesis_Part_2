"(1) The air inside Trinity Church was thick with a faint scent of old stone and pressed lavender as dusk draped itself over New York. Glass walls stretched skyward, letting in the gold and violet of a late spring twilight. In the hushed, vaulted space, the murmur of a select crowd coiled beneath the arches, anticipation humming beneath the elegant vaulted ceiling.\n\n(2) Levi Rodriguez moved through the shadowed entranceway, the sound of applause and laughter rising like a tide from below. His mind buzzed with nervous excitement—he’d spent the week preparing for this panel on “Sustainability in the Modern Age.” But now, as the gilded doors swung closed behind him, he could only focus on the present.\n\n(3) On the main stage, the silk fabrics caught the light in ways he’d never seen before.
