"(1) The evening’s air, tinged with the faint scent of rain and warm leather from the lobby’s seats, wrapped around Noah as he waited in the wide, arched corridor of the Woolworth Building. His hands lingered awkwardly in the pockets of his navy coat, the chandeliers overhead casting a golden glow across marble floors, their reflections fractured in the glass of the nearby store windows.
