"(1)  \nA low drizzle pattered against the wide bay window of the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, distorting the city’s evening glow into streaks of smeared amber and blue. Levi moved through the marble halls, the scent of old wood and fresh coffee clinging to the air, his boots echoing in the cavernous atrium. Rows of glass-clad rooms hummed with murmured conversations and the flick of projection screens, each surface reflecting a thousand sharp angles and shifting shadows. He slipped past a flotilla of scientists in lab coats clustered at a podium, the murmur growing louder as he approached the main stage—the locus of all eyes for tonight’s keynote.\n\n(2)  \nOn this particular evening of May 28, 2025, the Snug Harbor Cultural Center was the epicenter of possibility and suspicion, the conference hall abuzz with the promise of breakthroughs and the ever-present threat of revelation. Levi stood in the center of the floor, notebook trembling in his grip, as the moderator’s voice crackled through the sound system. He glanced at the presentation screens—his topic, still raw in his mind, lay just beyond the next graph. Now, as he took the podium, he felt the weight of countless pairs of eyes on him; he was here not to present an idea, but to discuss its potential applications, each word a gamble that someone might recognize a formula for danger.  \n\n(3)  \nLevi Rodriguez adjusted his collar, the spotlight sharp on his throat. Across the polished stage, a bank of microphones waited, but his attention stayed fixed on the faces in the audience—each $entity_1 with a name tag and a reputation. He tried to recall his own voice from earlier rehearsals, to steady it for this moment. He was supposed to explain the mathematical pathways that could turn theoretical constructs into real-world tools. No one here knew he’d spent weeks modeling these equations to anticipate exactly this line of questioning, nor what it might cost to uncover what was beneath the surface.  \n\n(4)  \nSuddenly, a phone buzzed in the row behind him, muffled but unmistakable. Levi froze mid-sentence. The hum of the auditorium shifted as someone near the front door turned, eyes narrowing at the source. He felt it—the prickle of threat woven into the hum of conversation.
