"(1)  \nThe glass walls of The Vessel shimmered with refracted sunlight, the day humming with the low thrum of a thousand voices in an auditorium carved from concrete and ambition. Overhead, holographic displays flickered blue and green—abstract models of quantum fields, neural webs, and climate projections. Logan Diaz watched the floor plan light up on his wrist as he slipped through the crowd, the buzz around him a familiar murmur in his ears, layered now with something new: the sharp tang of anxiety and the certainty that someone here already knew the answer he would present soon. He paused by the registration desk, the scent of machine oil and coffee hanging in the air, his breath slowing as the gavel's symbolic resonance echoed in the sub-bass.\n\n(2)  \nInside room four-b, beneath a ceiling dusted with motes that danced in the shifting light of smart LEDs, Logan found his spot at the head of a long oval table. Rows of $entity_1, $entity_2, and $entity_3 waited in expectant silence. The controversial theory was laid out in his slides: that the universe’s fundamental constants weren’t fixed but flickered in response to collective human consciousness, a heresy in a room lined with skeptics and mathematicians. As he began, the room stilled further. Someone in the third row exchanged a glance with another; a ripple of tension passed through the audience, charged with the electric anticipation that this debate, whatever its fallout, would change the course of discussion. His own pulse echoed that ripple, sharp and unmistakable.\n\n(3)  \nLogan Diaz’s voice—steady, but unsteady beneath—cut through the silence. “If you accept the entropy of observation as a causal factor,” he said, fingers flicking across a touchscreen that displayed his evolving equations, “then the ‘objective’ reality we measure is only ever the reality the group has already agreed upon.” A murmur rippled. The $entity_4 at his left leaned forward, pen poised. Logan’s mind raced, cataloguing each shift in body language and tone, searching for the flaw or the spark—proof the controversy would not be so easily buried. The debate pressed on, each rebuttal a piece on a chessboard where the stakes were higher than theory or acclaim; he sensed the boundaries of truth shifting, inch by careful inch.\n\n(4)  \nMidway through the Q&A, with the clock ticking past the hour, Logan caught a subtle shift in $"
