"(1) The late afternoon sun slanted through a hush of snowdrifts that lined the cracked flagstones of a deserted plaza. Beneath the pale gold light, a dozen sculptures shimmered with the illusion of life—twisted ladders of blue and silver, fractured lions melting into mist, spirals of ice that seemed to pulse with secret currents. Benjamin watched from behind a stand of evergreen boughs as the sculptures shifted in the cold air, their reflections fractured by the glassy surface of the nearby fountain. The murmurs of passing crowds were muted here, swallowed by the hush of February and the gathering cold.\n\n(2) A thin crowd gathered, drawn not only by curiosity but perhaps by the sense that something ephemeral and precious was unfolding before their eyes. Children stared with wide-eyed wonder at the shifting figures, while adults leaned close to examine the fine lace of frost that webbed over the sculptures' edges.
