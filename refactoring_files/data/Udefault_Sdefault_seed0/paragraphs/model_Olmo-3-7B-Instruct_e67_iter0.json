"(1)\n\nThe hum of expectation was thick in the marble halls as Maya Smith stepped into the luminous foyer, its glass-and-steel curves echoing off sterile white walls. A haze of sterile air tinged faintly with the scent of ozone and circuitry clung to her, curling around her as she approached the stage. Cameras blinked and lenses focused, their red and blue lights dancing in her peripheral vision. She wore a simple charcoal blazer, but as she raised a hand to the microphone, her pulse quickened. On cue, a screen behind her displayed a model of the new device, unblemished and radiant beneath cold white light. But beneath the surface gloss, Maya’s fingers remembered the simulated impacts she’d just performed, the way the case had cracked yet held firm—a demonstration that was meant to impress. She forced a smile for the audience, though inside, her breaths came faster, as if the applause carried something less welcoming.\n\n(2)\n\nOn February 27, 2026, beneath the soaring concrete dome of the Museum of Modern Art, Maya Smith stood before the assembled crowd, the product gleaming at her feet while $entity_1—sharp-suited and unreadable—gestured to the Q&A panel.

She recognized the tremor—not in this room, but in the way the air itself seemed to shiver with each word spoken. The demonstration was supposed to be a triumph of resilience, but now the walls pressed in with every echo of applause, and Maya wondered if what she had proven was the product’s strength, or something far less testable about the very foundation beneath their feet in the Museum of Modern Art."
