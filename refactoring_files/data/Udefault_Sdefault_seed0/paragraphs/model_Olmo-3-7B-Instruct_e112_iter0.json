"(1)  \nThe air inside Trinity Church felt thick, suffocating, as though the cold stone vaults and the flickering grid lights above had conspired to swallow all else. Rows of battered laptops hummed in the hallowed space, their glow trembling against the faded frescoes. Around Carter, a smattering of developers in hoodies and sweatpants hunched over terminals, their fingers flying over keyboards. Whispers of caffeine and static electricity hung in the musty air, punctuated by the clack of rapid keystrokes and the distant, echoing sound of someone’s boots on ancient tiles.\n\n(2)  \nIt was June 08, 2026, a day that began like any other, but the clock inside the stained glass window seemed to move strangely slow. The digital displays above each workbench blinked in time with a pulse in Carter’s chest—uneasy, racing. Every head turned as the event kicked off with a quick briefing, but Carter barely heard it. His focus was pinned to the screen, where lines of code blurred under the strain of logic and something else—some invisible weight pressing down on the back of his mind.\n\n(3)  \nCarter coded prototype applications with a precision born of obsession. Lines stacked atop lines as if bricks in a crumbling tower, each one a fragile promise. But his latest build wouldn’t compile. The terminal window flashed error after error message, red text crawling up like living vines. Something in the logic was wrong—off by a single variable, or so he thought. But as he squinted at the screen, the cursor itself began to stutter, moving in stuttering bursts as if the keyboard itself was fighting against him.\n\n(4)  \nTrinity Church’s soaring arches had always been supposed to be a sanctuary, but now they loomed close and cold, shadows pooling at the altar where the light couldn’t reach. Through the mist rising from the floor, Carter saw faces twisted—not in anger or anxiety, but in that same unblinking stare as if the walls themselves were watching. The scent of old wood and incense was thick, but now it was tinged with something metallic, a coppery tang that made his stomach twist with anticipation.\n\n(5)  \nAs $entity_1 attempted to pitch his VR overlay solution, Carter finally looked up from the screen. His breath caught. The room seemed to pulse, as if every device was tethered to a silent current beneath the floor. He was called on to demo his code—his prototype. But as the mouse clicked to activate the interface, the projection flickered violently, fracturing into jagged geometric shapes that writhed across the walls. For a heartbeat, Carter swore"
