"(1) The hum of chattering tourists echoed off marble floors, mingled with the tang of ancient stone and the faintest whiff of espresso from a café tucked behind the jagged bone arches of the American Museum of Natural History. Zoe, utterly unflappable but looking as though someone had stuck a fake moustache on her (her own idea of “vintage art critic chic”), weaved through clusters of visitors clutching glossy brochures and eyeing the towering dioramas with equal parts awe and confusion. Through the glass corridors, the golden haze of sunlight filtering through tall windows made every photo frame look slightly smudged by celestial dust.  \n\n(2) She paused at the entrance to the contemporary photography wing, where a sign blazed: “Through Augmented Eyes – A Celebration of Thought in Focus.” A tour group had gotten so caught up in debating the best close-up of a squirrel in a bowtie that Zoe almost joined them, but the memory of last night’s experimental “photo-bombing” (which involved herself and a potted fern) made her reconsider.

I once saw a raccoon steal a camera on the Central Park bench.” The second person just shrugged, then pointed dramatically at Zoe’s piece, “Oh! That’s the one where the ‘landmark’ is actually a yoga mat, right?” Zoe couldn’t help but chuckle—her own work, which explored the concept of “found objects as existential metaphors,” had been reduced to a game of bingo.
