"(1) The museum’s grand rotunda shimmered beneath cold spotlights, casting long, wavering shadows over marble pillars that seemed to lean in, as if remembering something. Glass doors reflected a thousand fragmented faces, each illuminated by the cold, clinical glow of stage lights, their expressions inscrutable. Beneath the vaulted ceiling, time hung thick as velvet, and beneath it all, Chloe Castillo moved through the crowd, her heels clicking too loudly on the polished floor.\n\n(2) On the dais, draped in black velvet with silver trim, a collection of garments glided into the light, seams whispering secrets. The models moved with unnatural grace, their silhouettes sharp against the backdrop of prehistoric skeletons and glittering fossils. A hush pressed in around her, and somewhere in the throng, Chloe found herself drawn to the central stage, her mind already spinning questions—how could fabric hold meaning so absolute in a place so ancient?\n\n(3) The air carried an acrid scent—smoke, perhaps, or the residue of something long-buried.
