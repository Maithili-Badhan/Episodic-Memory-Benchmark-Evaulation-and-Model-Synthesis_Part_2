"(1)  \nDamp morning air bit through Chloe’s jacket as she waited by the concrete arches beneath the skeletal remains of old rail lines. The High Line stretched before her—glimmering but cold, steel girders etched in shadow, sunlight broken by jagged clouds. Her heart thrummed with a strange anticipation that wasn’t entirely her own; the echo of laughter from yesterday’s film screening clung to her mind, but tonight the atmosphere was different, thick with the metallic scent of rain-slicked gravel and something metallic beneath the dust.
