"(1)  \nThe chilly November air outside the Snug Harbor Cultural Center curled over the cobblestones, damp with last night’s rain and that unmistakable city-film grime. Inside, the lobby hummed with the nervous energy of a thousand sculptors and a single, very flustered event planner. Crystal chandeliers hung low, their light refracting through columns like shattered glass, casting everything in a sort of frosty, glittering limbo. This was no ordinary gallery: today, the Snug Harbor Cultural Center was home to its first—and, as it turned out, disastrous—ice sculpture dessert pairings.  \n\n(2)  \n scarlett thomas, the woman in the pale blue blazer three sizes too large and whose name, she later insisted, “doesn’t even have a ‘T’ in it if you squint,” stood nervously beside a display that featured an ice swan mid-poop. She adjusted her glasses and tried to look like someone who knew what she was doing. In reality, she knew precisely two things: she was here, and she shouldn’t have accepted the job.  \n\n(3)  \n$entity_1, the head of curation, a tall man with a beard meticulously groomed as if sculpting his own ego, approached her while a toddler clung to the hem of his overcoat. “Scarlett, dear,” he said, “the ‘Melting Moments’ sculpture keeps leaking, again. Do you have a plan?” Scarlett tried to picture her answer without sounding like she was about to confess to juggling ice cubes in front of a camera. “Maybe if we rotate it… and, uh, use more superglue?”  \n\n(4)  \nThe $entity_2, a bearded competitive ice artist from Winnipeg who’d arrived wearing three pairs of gloves (in case one melted), was demonstrating his “Frosty Frankenstein.” A gigantic ice fist, with a carrot nose and a monocle. He bit into the carrot, let it ooze juice across the ice, and then attempted to serve it with “Spicy Maple Whipped Cream,” which immediately collapsed. Scarlett stifled a giggle. If only she could pass a napkin through a penguin suit here, things would be perfect.  \n\n(5)  \nAs guests drifted past, Scarlett’s main mission was the “Dessert Dance”—her semi-mandated role. She stood behind a table cluttered with mismatched bowls of sorbet and what looked suspiciously like gelatin shots in tiny teacups. $entity_3,"
