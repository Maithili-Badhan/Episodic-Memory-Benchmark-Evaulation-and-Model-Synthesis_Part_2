"(1)  \nRain began tapping against the frosted glass of Woolworth Building’s upper floors as the clock inched toward noon. Inside the glass-walled atrium, the hum of laptop fans and murmured code blended with the faint aroma of instant coffee and hot metal. Mila stood near a table draped in a neon-green and cobalt banner for the Urban Data Hackathon, her fingers tracing the edges of a laptop screen displaying a swirl of interlinked graphs—her own data visualizations, alive with subtle shifts of color that pulsed as new data streamed in. The low glow of LED panels flickered off the marble walls, casting long shadows across faces illuminated by screens; every so often, a flash of the Woolworth Building’s historic sign caught her attention, half-obscured by hanging LED strips that gave the old brick a digital sheen. No one here spoke much unless typing or gesturing, but Mila could feel the weight of countless unseen problems and possible solutions hanging in the humid, code-scented air. She wondered, as a pair of $entity_2 bent over a holographic interface, whether the anomaly she’d spotted in her visualizations might finally point to an underlying glitch—or something stranger.\n\n(2)  \nA sudden hush swept through the main hall when a voice—soft, edged with uncertainty—called, “Mila? I need a second look at your dash.” Mila turned, her pulse quickening as $entity_3 approached, clutching a tablet with suspicious code scrolling across its display. The screen reflected the pattern of her visuals, but not as they should. She noticed the mismatched axes, the odd blurring in one quadrant, details that her original datasets hadn’t included. As she studied the anomaly, another $entity_4 swept past, their expression tight behind a dark visor, leaving behind a faint scent of solder and a whisper: “Find the source.” Mila felt a knot form in her chest—was this a breakthrough, or the first clue someone else wanted her to find? The Woolworth’s echoing footsteps seemed louder now, as if the building itself was echoing her racing thoughts."
