"(1)  \nThe marble expanse of the American Museum of Natural History’s main lobby glimmered under the sterile hum of overhead spotlights, as if the bones of ancient titans had been reassembled to frame this modern transaction. Samuel Parker pushed through the murmuring tide of candidates and recruiters, his eyes tracing the sleek displays of glass cases usually reserved for dinosaur skeletons and meteorites. His mission—quiet, clinical, efficient—was clear: to gather the company information required to complete his dossier. Each table bore the glossy insignia of competing corporations, their brochures stacked neatly as if protecting secrets that, if disturbed, could awaken something older than the dinosaur shadows along the far wall.  \n\n(2)  \nBy 10:17 a.m., the clock on the high arched ceiling had begun its slow, unblinking tick, marking October 09, 2025, as the air thickened with the scent of old stone and the metallic tang of anxiety. Samuel approached the third recruiter’s booth—a glass shell displaying the sharp angles of an eagle emblazoned in black and silver—but the man inside was motionless. A bead of condensation formed on the cool surface of the automatic door behind him and, when Samuel turned, the flickering light overhead cast elongated, trembling shadows that writhed along the polished floor. The company name, etched in blood-red lettering, seemed to pulse faintly, matching the rising tightness in his chest. He reached for the business card, but the paper felt oddly spongy, as if woven from fibers of forgotten documents.  \n\n(3)  \n$entity_2, the woman at the adjacent stand draped in a tailored coat, leaned forward as if listening to static. Her voice was a whisper, threaded with an unnatural resonance: \"They're all watching.\" Samuel’s fingers trembled as he withdrew his notepad and began to scribble. He couldn’t tell if she was speaking to him or the shadows clinging to the exhibit cases. The sound of footsteps echoed behind, out of sync with any real presence, and the name \"Samuel Parker\" echoed in his mind as a phrase half-erased by time. Now he understood—the company information wasn’t the only thing being collected that day."
