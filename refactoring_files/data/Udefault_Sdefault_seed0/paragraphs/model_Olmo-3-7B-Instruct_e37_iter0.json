"(1)  \nA cool, metallic tang hung in the air as dusk settled over the sprawling field. Neon reflections flickered on the grass, slicing the orange light of stadium floodlights into liquid gold. Overhead, a massive screen pulsed with the chatter and music of dozens of teams hustling through their last hours of the hackathon. Henry slipped quietly into the row behind row, the rhythmic thump of distant drums merging with the scent of hot circuit boards and stale coffee that seemed to saturate everything.\n\n(2)  \nThe crowd was a mosaic of silvery-haired mentors, wide-eyed students clutching laptops, and the ever-present organizers in sleek black shirts. Some teams clustered tightly around glowing monitors, animated voices overlapping as they debugged wild code.
