"(1)  \nThe air bit sharply with the faint tang of rain that still clung to the evening's promise, mingling with the rustle of wind through the ancient ironwork of Washington Square Park. Shadows stretched long across the cracked flagstones beneath flickering amber streetlights, their glow reflected in the still pools of a rain-slicked plaza where dozens gathered for the annual astronomy night. Above, the sky was a bruised indigo, not a single star yet piercing through, as if the heavens themselves were holding their breath.\n\n(2)  \nFrom behind a folding table draped in pale blue cloth, Zoe organized her small group of seven students, hands deft as she adjusted a battered telescope. Her voice cut through the murmur of the crowd, calm yet deliberate as she explained celestial navigation—how to chart the invisible rails of the cosmos by reading the subtle dance of distant stars. Her fingers, dusted faintly with flour from earlier, moved with the assurance of someone who’d mapped these same constellations countless times before.\n\n($entity_1 approached the table, shivering despite the sweater she wore. Zoe noted the way the other woman’s knuckles were pale, as if nervous more than cold.)\n\n(3)  \nBy eight o’clock, the park’s perimeter hummed with anticipation: children huddled around smaller telescopes, adults crowded along the rail, and the scent of hot chocolate drifted over the damp grass. Zoe scanned the crowd, her gaze sharp even in the half-light, calculating angles in her mind as the first constellations began to prickle through the clouds. The date—December 26, 2026—was almost invisible, marked only by the faint chill of winter and the knowledge that the sky tonight would change nothing for most, but everything for her students.\n\n(4)  \nJust as $entity_2 reached for a star chart, a distant thump reverberated through the park, and a flash of movement caught Zoe’s eye behind the row of lampposts. Her breath hitched—celestial navigation was meant to be quiet, methodical, but the universe tonight felt suddenly unscripted. As she quickly turned, $entity_3 stumbled forward, face white, pointing in the direction of the noise. Zoe’s pulse raced as she snapped on the telescope, the glass trembling slightly in her hands—this was no ordinary astronomy lesson. Tonight, she would be their guide through a sky that was about to reveal its secrets, whatever the cost."
