"(1)  \nThe morning hush lay heavy over the vast concrete and grassy stretches of the former field, sunlight filtering through the skeletal remains of old scoreboards and the ragged canvas banners tied between sycamore trees. Zoe walked among the throng of reenactors, her boots sinking slightly into the worn turf, the air thick with the scent of autumn leaves and distant, unseasonal smoke from grilling meat. Tables, covered with hand-stitched cloths and gleaming pewter, lined the open concourse. The crowd shifted, murmuring in period costumes, their faces a mosaic of anticipation and nerves as the day’s staged dawn crept closer.\n\n(2)  \nIt was November 07, 2025—the year the World Series was broadcast from this very site—and Zoe Brown’s hands trembled as she arranged the final stall of her market. Paper menus fluttered above baskets of “Colonial Baked Goods,” and vendors, both participants and locals, moved with careful reverence.

Zoe paused by a food cart, observing a family huddled under a blanket, sharing a plate of cornbread as reenactors in period uniforms paraded by in slow, uncertain steps. She thought of how her ancestors might have sat, or run, or cheered here, and the weight of expectation pressed down like the autumn sky.
