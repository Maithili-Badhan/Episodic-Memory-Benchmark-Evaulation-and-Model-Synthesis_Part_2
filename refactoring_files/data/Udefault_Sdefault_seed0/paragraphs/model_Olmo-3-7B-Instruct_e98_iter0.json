"The spotlight carved its way through the dimmed auditorium, catching the silver threads of an emerald gown as it glided over the polished stage. Levi’s chest tightened with anticipation, the hum of low conversation echoing off marble columns and the faint, antediluvian scent of the museum’s ancient halls mingling with modern cologne.
