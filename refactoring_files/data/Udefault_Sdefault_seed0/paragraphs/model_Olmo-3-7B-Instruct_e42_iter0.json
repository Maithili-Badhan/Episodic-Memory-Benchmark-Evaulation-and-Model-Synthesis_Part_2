"(1)  \nThe night air over Williamsburg Bridge hung thick and still, pressing in with a weight that made even the distant hum of the city below seem muffled. Bella Alvarez walked the railing’s cold metal, her breath fogging in the starless sky, while spotlights from a makeshift observatory glimmered along the river. Around her, other guests clustered in folding chairs, their faces illuminated by the soft, unearthly glow of projected constellations. Bella’s pulse quickened with anticipation—she knew tonight was special, a rare convergence of celestial alignment and human curiosity, and she’d spent months orchestrating every detail. Here, under the vast, indifferent dark, she’d orchestrated not just an astronomy night, but the unlikely event of space food tastings, each plate a fragile offering from worlds beyond Earth.\n\n(2)  \nAs the sky above Williamsburg Bridge deepened to inky velvet, a faint, discordant static pulsed from the speakers—unlike the usual ambient music. Bella watched as $entity_1, a stranger in a neon-green astronaut suit, approached with a tray laden with unfamiliar cubes and pouches. Their flavor was otherworldly: a metallic tang laced with hints of ozone and something faintly mineral. Bella reached for a sample, hesitating as $entity_2, their friend, whispered nervously about the star charts not matching the real sky. The ground beneath them vibrated imperceptibly, almost like the bridge itself was breathing. The taste lingered on her tongue, sharp and unnatural, while somewhere on the deck, a constellation flickered with a red light that should not be there."
