"(1)  \nThe morning hush clung to the upstate grass like a damp, breathing thing as Ezra moved through the entrance gate. A low mist curled off the dew-soaked turf, veiling the black synthetic slopes of Bethpage Black Course in a shifting gray sheen. His pulse quickened, not from fear—though that always lingered beneath his ribs—but from anticipation. He knew today was no ordinary session. The air smelled of rubber, fresh earth, and the faintest trace of sunscreen.  \n\n(2)  \nInside, the concrete course stretched before him—Bethpage Black’s notorious training ground—its angular ramps and uneven walls bathed in the slanted gold of early September light.
