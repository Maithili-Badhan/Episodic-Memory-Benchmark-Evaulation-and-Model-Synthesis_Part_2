"A hush had fallen over the park before the noon sun could fully claim it. Shards of sunlight filtered through the skeletal branches overhead, painting the marble and glass that lined the center with an opalescent sheen. Among the murmuring crowd, Benjamin Green observed the symphony of white: spirals of ice spiraled upwards, jagged monoliths gleamed, and delicate figurines shimmered like captured breath. But beneath the dazzling surfaces, his mind was heavy, as though the warmth of the early February afternoon clung to him as an unwelcome memory.\n\nNearby, an artist in a navy windbreaker labored over a block of translucent ice, chiseling intricate patterns that bled opalescent light. Around them, spectators stopped and stared, the tension between awe and silence palpable. Benjamin felt the press of the crowd, the quiet reverence, the way heads turned toward the stage where the curated masterpieces stood sentinel.

Without thinking, he approached, offering quiet words of comfort, though his voice trembled and faltered. She didn’t react at first, but when he spoke of the fragile beauty of ice and how quickly time could erode even what seemed eternal, her shoulders quivered. Benjamin realized too late that he was not the one conducting the talk here, but merely a silent witness to fragile hearts meeting in the chill.\n\nHe turned to go, but paused when another figure appeared—the $entity_2, a broad-"
