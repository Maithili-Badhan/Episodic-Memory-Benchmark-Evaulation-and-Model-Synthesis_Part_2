"(1)  \nA shiver of anticipation ran through Samuel Parker as he stepped through the ornate iron gates, their surface glinting with an otherworldly iridescence that seemed to pulse in time with the distant echoes of laughter. The vast halls of the American Museum of Natural History glowed under a strange, shifting light that flickered between amber and sapphire, as though the very stone had learned to mimic the moods of a living thing. Crowds surged around him, swirling like a tide of color beneath vaulted ceilings adorned with enormous, living murals—dinosaurs striding across amber floors, celestial beings suspended above glass domes, the boundaries between exhibit and art dissolving under a twilight hush.

Samuel’s mind wandered to the debates he’d recently argued over in the candlelit salon of the Opera Guild, debates on the merits of allegorical staging versus pure illusionism. As the intermission approached, he found himself called upon, his voice unexpectedly raised above the murmur: “I was discussing—well, considering—how recent innovations in projection magic alter our understanding"
