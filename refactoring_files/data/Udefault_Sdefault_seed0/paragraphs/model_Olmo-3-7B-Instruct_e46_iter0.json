"(1) The lobby of One World Trade Center had that peculiar New York grandiosity—endless glass, steel girders stretching toward infinity, and a scent that was mostly decaf espresso with a whiff of anxiety. Signage blinked in fluorescent green above reception desks, and a trio of security guards in neon vests debated the optimal angle to hold their riot shields, as though the fate of civilization depended on it. Above them all, the 110th-floor observation deck shimmered with the day’s first sunlight, catching on the twin towers of steel like some metallic lover’s quarrel.\n\n(2) Henry ducked into the conference hall, dodging a flailing drone that circled overhead like a disgruntled pigeon. He spotted his new clients: twelve teens and two adults, all crammed into folding chairs with laptops in hand, eyes darting toward him like he might suddenly morph into an interpretive dancer. His seminar today was “Body Language for Debate Victory,” which in his opinion was more theatrical than an off-Broadway revival of Hamlet.

He glanced at $entity_1, the first contestant, whose hands fluttered like a startled sparrow. “Remember, confidence isn’t about crossing your arms—it’s about not overthinking your crossing.”\n\n(5) As Henry demonstrated ‘defensive curl’ with his fingers—because he’d once misread a book on posture—there was a loud snort from $entity_2. “You conduct seminars on this stuff?” she asked, barely hiding amusement. “I just learned to argue with my boss without raising my voice.” Henry nodded solemnly,"
