"The hush pressed down through the vaulted stone ceiling, a velvet shroud enveloping the ornate chancel of the old building. Sunlight filtered through stained glass, fracturing into ribbons of color that danced upon the worn marble floor. From the wings beyond the pews drifted the faintest buzz of anticipation, punctuated by the rattle of program notes and the muffled murmur of a departing audience. High above, the arched windows of Trinity Church framed the lingering warmth of late afternoon, making the room feel both ancient and impossibly immediate. Every breath echoed, magnified by the emptying spaces.\n\nA distant swell of strings drew Levi’s attention from his spot near the front, halfway hidden in the shadows cast by his cello case. The scent of old wood and incense was sharp in the air, mingling with the clean, cool current of the air conditioning. He watched as the ushers moved through the rows, straightening crumpled programs and smoothing the creases of velvet-cushioned seats.

Violins wept their sorrow across the silvered wood, the cellos answered with a deep, resonant heart.

A woman beside him shuddered, a man to the left closed his eyes tighter, as if seeking the same solace Levi had once sought.\n\nFor a moment, his mind drifted. He saw not the audience, but the empty hall as it might have been before the first performance, when the echoes were undisturbed. The weight of expectation coiled around him; it was not only music filling the air but the unspoken presence of his own past self.
