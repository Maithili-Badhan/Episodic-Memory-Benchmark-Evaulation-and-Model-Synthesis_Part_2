"The morning mist hung low and stubborn over the fairgrounds, clinging to the grass and the iron railings where pale sunlight barely pierced. Logan Diaz moved through the throng as if the air itself weighed heavier than his invisible future, eyes fixed on the stage where glossy brochures and the scent of industrial air freshener mingled. Each booth promised new beginnings—digital screens flashing, pitchforks of optimism raised by recruiters in pressed shirts. He felt the click of his own shoes, the hush in his chest, knowing he was present to listen and to be listened to, but never quite certain how either would turn out.\n\nA distant bell tolled, a sound both ceremonial and hollow, echoing through the expanse of neat folding chairs and folding tables. Company representatives arrived in pairs, trailing briefcases like pallbearers of hope. Logan kept to the edge of the crowd, observing how the lines grew and shrank with each passing minute, how every handshake felt both a greeting and a farewell. He noticed the way $entity_1, a woman in a sharp navy blazer, pressed her lips together before addressing a line of nervous applicants, her eyes flicking to the clock with each word. It was as if she knew she had only borrowed time.\n\nNear the far end, a towering screen displayed the bold letters “Bethpage Black Course,” the venue itself a monolith of ambition and expectation. The summer heat pressed in, heavy with the promise of deadlines yet unmet. Logan lingered beside a refreshment stand, watching the hands of time move inexorably forward—while his own felt stuck in a loop. Somewhere behind him, $entity_2 adjusted his tie, glancing sidelong at Logan with a silent question no words could answer. The clock in the center of the room pulsed red, counting down the seconds before the first interview began.\n\nJuly 25, 2024, was the name whispered in the air—unspoken, yet undeniable. Each panel discussion was a quiet duel: the candidate’s words sharpened against the corporate script. Logan watched a young man falter when asked about his strengths, his hands shaking so fiercely the folder nearly fell. Another candidate, more poised, answered smoothly, but the interviewer’s eyes lingered a second too long on a small blemish in his sleeve. The tension was thick enough to choke on, yet nobody dared release it. The tragedy lay not just in what was said, but in what went unsaid—unspoken fears, fading opportunities.\n\n"
