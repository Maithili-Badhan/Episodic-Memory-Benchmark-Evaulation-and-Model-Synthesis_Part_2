"(1) Mila’s hands shook—not from nerves, but from the sheer absurdity of the situation: she was the “host” of a compound bow competition, which in layman’s terms meant she was supposed to oversee things but mostly ended up explaining the rules to a squirrel that had somehow gotten into the quiver area. The scent of freshly mowed grass mixed with the sharp tang of arrow wax, and above, the April sky squinted through the last bits of March fog. The crowd, a patchwork of tourists, local students, and one very confused competitive fiddle player, buzzed with a combination of excitement and existential confusion about what was going on.\n\n(2) Mila tried to project confidence while fending off a determined raccoon that kept swiping arrows off the target line. “Excuse me!” she called out, brandishing an empty water bottle, “That’s for $entity_1’s round!” The spectators roared with laughter when $entity_2, a man in full medieval garb, accidentally launched his arrow through the event poster instead of the bullseye. Mila’s own attempts at shooting were interrupted every two minutes by someone asking, “Does this count if you drop the arrow in the pond?” or “Wait, is that a bird or just bad aim?” The world of high-stakes archery had clearly collapsed into slapstick chaos.\n\n(3) On this fateful March 23, 2024 in Washington Square Park, Mila found herself the accidental star—juggling lost arrows, fielding bizarre questions (“Can you shoot if your shoes are untied?”), and delivering her ‘compulsory’ hosting speech, which devolved into an improv routine involving the phrase “triple whammy”. Yet as the sun dipped and the last arrow soared, Mila’s competitive spirit survived, if not her dignity. The compound bow competition had ended in laughter, mayhem, and, in one memorable case, a squirrel triumphantly clutching an entire quiver—leaving everyone wondering what the next day of madness at Mila’s hosting gig would bring."
