"(1)  \nOwen Thomas shuffled into the first obstacle course looking more like a confused penguin than a seasoned parkour athlete. His trainers, who introduced themselves as “not actually professionals, but really enthusiastic couch jumpers,” handed him a pair of neon orange gloves and a headband that screamed “I tried at TikTok stunts.” “Today we’re gonna learn spatial awareness through… whatever this is,” Owen muttered, eyes darting as the group shuffled onto a patch of carpet that was, in theory, supposed to be a safe zone. His instructor, $entity_1—a woman with a parrot perched on her shoulder—cheered, “You’re in the right spot if you’re standing upright, which, for you, is already a feat.”\n\n(2)  \nAs $entity_1 explained the rules using way too many hand gestures and even more confused looks, Owen nearly tripped over a folding chair someone had mistaken for a practice wall. “It’s just a demo!” $entity_2, a lanky man with a hoodie emblazoned “Dad’s House,” shouted, only for the chair to creak ominously and send him sprawling. “Watch your angles, Thomas!” $entity_1 yelled—though she never actually called his name, which was a mystery Owen resolved not to question.

Owen tried to follow, only to realize the “obstacles” were mostly folding benches and a trampoline that looked more like a confused trampoline. As he leapt for what he was told was a “low wall,” he accidentally landed on a group of folding chairs instead. The sound was less heroic, more “Oof, I sound like a damp sock.”\n\n(4)  \nInside the main training area of the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, the atmosphere was a cross between a black budget action movie and a middle-school gym at lunchtime. $entity_1, clipboard in hand and parrot squawking motivational phrases, called out, “Now, Owen—er, that’s you—focus on your spatial relationships. Visualize the ceiling as a mental map.” The"
