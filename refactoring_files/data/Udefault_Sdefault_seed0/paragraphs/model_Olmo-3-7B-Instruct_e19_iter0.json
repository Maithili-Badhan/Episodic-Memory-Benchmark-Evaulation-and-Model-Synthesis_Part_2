"(1)  \nThe morning sun had just begun to stretch pale fingers across the East River when Hazel Lewis first arrived at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge. The steel arches of the oldest suspension span, encrusted with the patina of decades, gleamed faintly gold under the early light. Around her, the crowd hummed with restless anticipation—tents flapping in the bracing wind, camera bags thumping against shoulders, the sharp tang of ozone and old stone in the air.\n\n(2)  \nHazel knew this was no ordinary gathering. She had organized these historical fashion shows for years, each one a way to resurrect the ghosts of bygone eras right where the pulse of modern Brooklyn beat loudest. This particular event promised to blur the line between past and present, history and memory. She moved through the throng, clipboard pressed against her chest, her own crisp linen dress a silent challenge to the chaos surrounding her.\n\n(3)  \nA group of reenactors in period garb bustled along the walkways, their movements exaggerated and almost theatrical. One woman in a 19th-century morning wrap strode ahead, her heels clicking like small gunfire, trailed by a man in a dandy’s top hat and monocle. The scent of vanilla candle wax mingled with the damp chill of the river breeze, making the air feel thick and close, as though the very atmosphere held its breath.\n\n(4)  \nHazel, the unseen architect of these spectres on silk and lace, paused beside a vendor selling real wool capes. She adjusted the hem of her own dress, her heart fluttering with a peculiar mixture of excitement and unease. The crowd parted around her, but no one saw the faint shadow that briefly flickered behind her at the edge of vision. For a moment, she wondered if she’d imagined it—or if the past itself had come to walk the iron rails.\n\n(5)  \nAcross the span, actors assembled for a Civil War ball, their costuming immaculate, their gestures stiff and ritualistic. Their faces betrayed a forced grace, yet in their eyes, Hazel caught glimpses that did not belong: a flicker, not of light, but something deeper, as if memory itself had skin. She clutched her clipboard tighter, the fabric prickling against her palm. The distant toll of the bridge’s bells sounded twice, as if echoing through the centuries.\n\n(6)  \nA child in a replica 1920s flapper dress tumbled"
