"(1) At dusk on October 09, 2025, Henry Reed stood alone beneath the skeletal bones of the Van Cortlandt Park overpass, the night air sharp with the tang of damp grass and the distant hum of the city beyond, as a murmur of laughter and music rolled in from the nearby pavilion lit by string lights and neon-blue glow sticks. His throat burned with anticipation as he adjusted his collar, glancing at the handwritten sign posted at the entrance—“Karaoke Open Mic – Don’t Stop Believing!”—and felt the crowd’s pulse quicken as another singer’s voice cracked on “Bohemian Rhapsody.” Taking a breath that felt like a dare, Henry stepped up to the mic, eyes scanning the faces behind the plastic stage—three $entity_1$ in hoodies grinning with competitive smirks, a couple of $entity_2$ couples already tangled in a dance-off, and a lone woman with a bullhorn, calling out encouragement and maybe a warning. The park’s acrid scent of falling leaves mingled with the neon’s electric blue as he closed his eyes and hit the first high note—rough, shaky, but deliberate—then soared, the sound slicing through the hum and drawing a collective gasp from the onlookers as he dared the world to judge his falsetto."
