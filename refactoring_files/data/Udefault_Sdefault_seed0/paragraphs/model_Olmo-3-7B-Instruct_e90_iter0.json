"(1)  \nA flicker of blue light danced along the marble floors as Scarlett Thomas slipped through the swirling, ancient archways of the gallery. The hum of conversation, sharp and electric, vibrated through her bones—a cacophony of fingers tapping keyboards and voices weaving through shadows thrown by arched ceilings. The familiar hush of the museum, usually so reverent, was now thick with the scent of coffee, solder, and the ozone bite of overtaxed circuits.
