"(1)  \nOwen shuffled into the cavernous expanse of the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, his sneakers squeaking a nervous rhythm on the polished concrete. He clutched a crumpled handout titled “Fundamentals of Free Space: Or How Not to Face-plant Today.” The air smelled faintly of boiled garlic from the kitchen next door—a scent that seemed to seep into every corner.
