"(1)  \nThe marble floors of the Metropolitan Museum of Art gleamed dully under the shifting light of March morning, its hushed galleries a cathedral of shadows and hushed anticipation. Scarlett Thomas moved through the throng of festivalgoers with an invisible tether at her back, her mind already parsing the intricate grid of film reels and projectors that she alone had assembled for this event. Every corridor here whispered centuries of history, but today it hummed with the electric current of innovation, flickering across screens as dozens of films, in formats both analog and digital, awaited their turn. Her footsteps echoed softly, blending with the distant murmur of critics and the clink of champagne flutes—yet beneath the surface, she was tracking patterns and discrepancies, wondering how the projected frames on these hallowed walls had been chosen and, perhaps, manipulated.\n\n(2)  \nShe paused beside a massive installation where vintage lenses refracted light into kaleidoscopic bands, the curator—a bespectacled woman in her late forties marked as $entity_1—gestured toward a monitor showing an out-of-focus clip. The footage, ostensibly a documentary from 1972, stuttered every eight seconds with a digital artifact Scarlett hadn’t programmed. Intrigued, Scarlett leaned in, her fingers tracing the cold edge of the glass. A group of students from Columbia gathered nearby, whispering theories about projector glitches; their excitement felt performative, but she noticed one man—$entity_2, she decided, by his rumpled blazer—studying the same screen with narrowed eyes, his expression tense and unreadable. Perhaps these were clues waiting to be unraveled, or maybe the real mystery was something far subtler, woven into the very fabric of the screenings.\n\n(3)  \nMid-afternoon saw Scarlett presiding at her own exhibit: a curated suite of advanced film technologies, including a digital projector she’d designed to replicate the grain and color shifts of celluloid even on modern screens. Visitors moved through in quiet awe, pausing to study the hand-labeled panels describing the history and mechanics of each piece. Behind the glass, Scarlett watched the curious faces of $entity_3, a tech enthusiast with a smartphone camera, who lingered by a vintage projector, his questions precise and probing. When a journalist approached for an interview ($entity_4), Scarlett deftly pivoted, her mind still calculating the anomalies she’d observed in the earlier screenings—a missed frame, a mismatched audio sync, a flash of"
