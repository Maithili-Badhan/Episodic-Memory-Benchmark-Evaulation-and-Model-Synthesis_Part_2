"The mid-afternoon sun pressed through tangled sycamore branches overhead, dappling the edges of an abandoned fairgrounds with slanted light. Rusted tarps sagged like sick animals over the iron skeleton of tents, their faded banners still fluttering faintly in a still, buzzing air. The scent of popcorn, rust, and something sharp and metallic hung thick—like the sweat of unseen things.\n\nHe didn't realize he was walking until his boots crunched over something glassy. The ground was littered with objects: jagged plastic swords, chipped mugs with faded patterns, coins that shouldn't have been there. A low, synthetic giggle drifted from somewhere behind him. Each shadow seemed to linger, pulsing with the memory of motion.
