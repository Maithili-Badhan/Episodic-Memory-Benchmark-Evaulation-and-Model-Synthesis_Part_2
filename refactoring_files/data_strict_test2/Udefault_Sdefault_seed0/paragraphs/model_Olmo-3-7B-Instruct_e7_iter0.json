"(1) (i) , renowned for his uncanny ability to trip over his own shoelaces while still performing impressive parkour stunts, arrived at the clutching a crumpled notepad and a half-eaten bagel. The workshop’s flyer had promised “Advanced Spatial Awareness for the Average Joe,” but Owen suspected it was code for “How to trip spectacularly while pretending you’re a ninja.” He glanced at the clock: it was only 9:17 AM, giving him just enough time to avoid the first obstacle before it became an actual problem.
